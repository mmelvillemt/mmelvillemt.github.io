EECS 280 Project 4
===========================
Doubly linked list.

By Mason Melville <mmelv@umich.edu>

## Longer Description
Created a doubly linked list

The learning goals of this project include Container ADTs, Dynamic Memory, The Big Three, Linked Lists, and Iterators. Gained experience with new and delete, constructors and destructors, and the List data structure that is similar to std::list from the standard library.

Written by me: List.hpp, List_tests.cpp
